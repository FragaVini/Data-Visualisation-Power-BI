# Data-Visualisation-Power-BI

In this section I will list the data visualisation projects, describing which tools have been used.

## Projects

### Investment portfolio

**Code:** **Code:** [`Investment Portfolio.pbix`](https://github.com/FragaVini/Data-Visualisation-Power-BI/blob/main/Investment%20Portfolio/Stock.pbix)

**Goal:** Present the historical data of an investment portfolio to analyse its performance.

**Description:** The project consisted of presenting the data of a Brazilian investment portfolio month by month, along with its monthly return. Different dashboards were created for each type of investment, allowing them to be analysed separately. Different metrics were used to analyse the portfolio's performance, comparing it with inflation and the Ibovespa, for example. Data on dividends received is also presented, and can be differentiated according to the type of investment. 

**Results:** The portfolio as a whole shows a negative return (-0.13%), but better than the IBOV (-3.56%) over the same period. Real estate funds were largely responsible for the dividend returns.

**Tools:** clustered column chart, line and clustered column chart, pie chart, card, KPI, slicer and table.

**Techonlogies:** PowerBi and Excel.
